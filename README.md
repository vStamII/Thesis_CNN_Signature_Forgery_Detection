# Thesis_CNN_Signature_Forgery_Detection
My thesis comparative study of convolutional neural networks in signature forgery detection in the code you generate plots, confusion matrixes, heatmaps for all the available cnn models.

In the data folder there are 2 files
1. full_forg: Contains 1320 forgery signatures (24 forgeries for each of 55 writers).
2. full_org: Contains 1320 genuine signatures (24 genuines for each of 55 writers).
