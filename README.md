# Comparative Study of Convolutional Neural Networks in Signature Forgery Detection

This repository contains the thesis "Comparative Study of Convolutional Neural Networks in Signature Forgery Detection". The study evaluates multiple CNN architectures to determine their effectiveness in detecting forged signatures.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this study is the CEDAR Dataset and consists of:
- full_forg: 1320 forged signatures (24 forgeries per writer, 55 writers in total).

- full_org: 1320 genuine signatures (24 genuine signatures per writer, 55 writers in total).

### Features

- Implementation of multiple CNN architectures for signature verification.

- Generation of confusion matrices for model performance comparison.

- Heatmaps to interpret model decision-making.

- Performance evaluation across different CNN models.
